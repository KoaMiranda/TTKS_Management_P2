Expand on the original route-finding program by adding a k-means clustering implementation, so that locations can be split up amongst multiple drones.

Mr. Keogh tasked us with upgrading the route-finding program we had previously made to dispense pheromones amongst trees in his orchard in order to stop harmful pests in his orchard from ruining crops. Since then Mr. Keogh has expanded this drone delivery operation to several more locations across his farm. However he found that the increase in time and labor costs for the drone operator due to this expansion were mounting quickly and wanted a solution. The conclusion Mr. Keogh reached was to buy more drones and split up the work. He now owns 4 drones total and wishes to operate them simultaneously, which would drastically cut down the time and labor costs. But the program we previously built can handle at most 256 locations, which is only a small percentage of the locations in the entire orchard. Like last time, Mr. Keogh would like TTKS Management to provide a program that can take in all these programs and produce an optimal route. This time however, he would also like to know what the optimal number of drones to use to canvas the area and where to set up each landing pad. After this meeting and discussions with our esteemed colleague Dr. Keogh, we recognized that this problem can be solved via k-means clustering algorithm.
